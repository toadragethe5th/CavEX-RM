# USING AND RUNNING

How I would do it: (IN ORDER)
# LINUX/UNIX ENVIRONMENT
- Move the source directory and your CavEX installation to your root.
- navigate to your root: ```cd ~```
- MAKE SURE YOUR DIRECTORY CONTAINING YOUR INSTALLATION OF THE GAME IS IN YOUR ROOT!
- make it executable: ```chmod +x patch.sh```
- execute it: ```./patch.sh```

# WINDOWS

- Move the source directory and your CavEX installation to your root.
- From here, you have 2 options: The lazy way, or the average way.
- For the lazy way, navigate to your root: ```cd ~```
- execute the batch file from the command line: ```.\source\main\windows\patch.bat```
- for the average way, just open up the batch file from file explorer.

FOR BOTH OF THESE, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SCREEN!
