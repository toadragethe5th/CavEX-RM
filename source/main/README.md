How I would do it: (IN ORDER)
# LINUX/UNIX
- Move the source directory to your root (```~```)
- navigate to the ```main``` directory: ```cd $home/source/main/```
- MAKE SURE YOUR DIRECTORY CONTAINING YOUR INSTALLATION OF THE GAME IS IN YOUR ROOT!
- make it executable: ```chmod +x patch.sh```
- execute it: ```./patch.sh```
